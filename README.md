An architectural pattern is a general, reusable resolution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
Pattern is an implementation that solves a particular problem. A principle is an abstraction, a guide to design.

* [CQR](cqs.md)
* [CQRS](cqrs.md)
* [Hexagonal Architecture](hexagonal_architecture.md)
* [Layered Architecture](layered_architecture.md)
* [DDD](ddd.md)

## Principles
* Durability
* Scalability
* Flexibility
* Encapsulation
* Testability
* Reduced Complexity (DI)
* Concentrate on Domain/Business
* Independence from framework, DB, UI, external service
