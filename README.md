# [Architecture](README.md)

## Software Architectural Patterns and development approaches

Architecture is a structure, a way to distribute your application components in various groups. There is not a single way to organize your projects because it could depend on several aspects like project state, team size, time constraints, etc

An architectural pattern is a general, reusable resolution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.
Pattern is an implementation that solves a particular problem. A principle is an abstraction, a guide to design.

There is no single way to structure a project, and each architecture has its characteristics. 
Even though you do not define an architecture, following the **SOLID** principles will lead you to maintain a well-organized code.

* [SOLID](solid.md)
* [CQR](cqs.md)
* [CQRS](cqrs.md)
* [Hexagonal Architecture](hexagonal_architecture.md)
* [Layered Architecture](layered_architecture.md)
* [DDD](ddd.md)

## Principles
* Durability
* Scalability
* Flexibility
* Encapsulation
* Testability
* Separation of Concerns
* Reduced Complexity (DI)
* Concentrate on Domain/Business
* Independence from framework, DB, UI, external service
